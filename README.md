## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

cd procurement-automation-app-be


```

### Install Dependencies

### Set Environment Variables

There's a `.env.example` file in the root directory of the project. Create a new file named `.env` and copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into it. Replace the values with your own.
